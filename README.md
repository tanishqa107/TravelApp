Travel Journal App

This is a travel journal app, which logs your travel photos with date and location for maintaining a entire collection for your travel photos.

âœ¨ Purpose of the App

This app helps travelers effortlessly document their journeys by logging travel photos along with the exact date and location where each was taken. Designed for explorers, backpackers, tourists, and adventure lovers, the app serves as a digital travel journal â€” creating a personalized timeline of memories across cities, countries, and experiences.

Instead of having scattered images in phone galleries or cloud drives, users can now organize their travel photos in one cohesive, location-aware collection. What inspired this app was the need for a simple yet powerful way to preserve travel stories â€” not just visually, but contextually â€” with time, place, and emotion captured in every post.
